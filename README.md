## Objective

In this project, I intend to create an engaging and responsive game. The aim of the game is to guess which song the shown lyric is from. The goal of this website is to further share my passion for music, creating questions around some of my favourite music. The main objective is to demonstrate my capabilities in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, creating a fun experience for those who play the game.

The target audience for this website is for anyone who enjoys listening to music and wants to put their knowledge to the test in this game!

# UX

### Initial Concept

A simple design with clear focus on the functionality of the game is key for this website. The design should be kept free from distractions as unnecessary clutter would take focus from the game itself. Using a colour scheme that is eye-catching yet with sufficient contrast to ensure all content is sufficiently readable. Only the relevant information will be shown - for example, when the game is in progress, the information about how to play it and also the results screen will be hidden. This will assist in keeping the design as streamlined as possible, avoiding potential confusion.

#### Wireframes

For initially designing the project, I utilised Balsamiq to produce wireframes. This step allows for planning how things will be laid out, allowing to focus more on getting it to look right and the functionality of the website instead of trying to simultaneously code and design.

#### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for this project ended up being something I debated quite a bit. I considered having a background image, but I couldn't find something that suited this project completely, without sacrificing on some of the key factors stated in the initial concept section. In the end, I settled on a very simple colour scheme, sticking with a solid yellow (#ffba08) background, with a white logo, black text and a mixture of Bootstrap's default and primary button styles. The end result is something that despite being simple, is still stylish and sufficiently contrasted.

#### Typography

The typography for this project was picked by browsing the google fonts website until I found something that really stood out to me. 

For the text logo, I wanted something that was more abstract and different to many of the more 'normal' typefaces. I ended up settling on the Poetsen One typeface, which appears more curved than many other typefaces and it stood out to me immediately. Using a heavier font weight, I was able to achieve the look I was going for.

The typeface Ubuntu was used for the rest of the website.
