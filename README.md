## Objective

In this project, I intend to create an engaging and responsive game. The aim of the game is to guess which song the shown lyric is from. The goal of this website is to further share my passion for music, creating questions around some of my favourite music. The main objective is to demonstrate my capabilities in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, creating a fun experience for those who play the game.

The target audience for this website is for anyone who enjoys listening to music and wants to put their knowledge to the test in this game!
